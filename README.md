# About

This is my personal website hosted at [bradpurchase.com](https://bradpurchase.com).

It's boring. It's just plain HTML and CSS. No javascript, no webpack - there's not even a CSS preprocessor. It was really nice to just let all that stuff go and really go back to my roots, just making a "website" like the old days and not making it too complicated.

However, if you feel like you want to dig around here, feel free! I'm going to keep this open source no matter what I do with it; why not?
